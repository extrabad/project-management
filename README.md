## Purpose
*A tool for per-project timestamped work logging.*
The point is so that when your boss asks you seven months later why you made a very specific design decision, you can send them the whole list of progress updates on the project throughout its lifecycle. 


## Build Instructions

This project tracker can be built with `go build -o <outdir/executablefilename>`

where the output directory and executable name are provided after the `-o` flag. 

ex. 

`go build` - will create an executable named "project-manager"

you can execute the file by running `./project-manager "my message"`
